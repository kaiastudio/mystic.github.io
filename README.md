**Log Data**

I'd like to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in the event of an app error, I collect data and information (via third-party products) on your phone known as Log Data. This Log Data may contain information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, app configuration when using my Service, time and date of use, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small data files that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser by the websites you visit and are stored in the internal memory of your device.
These "cookies" are not explicitly used by this Service. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that collect information and improve their services by using "cookies." You have the option to accept or reject these cookies and to be notified when a cookie is sent to your device.

**Service Providers**

I may hire third-party businesses and individuals for the following reasons:
To make our service more convenient;
To carry out the Service on our behalf;
to provide service-related activities; or
To help us analyze how our Service is used.

I'd like to notify Service users that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason for this is so that they can complete the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. They are, however, required not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

I appreciate your trust in entrusting us with your Personal Information, so we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But keep in mind that no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

As a result, I strongly advise you to read the Privacy Policies on these websites. I have no control over, and accept no responsibility for, any third-party sites or services' content, privacy policies, or practices.

These Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. I do not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If I discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately remove it from our servers.
